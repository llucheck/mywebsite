          Hi, my name is Leonard. I'm a recent graduate from Lewis 
          University with a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science.
          There I learned many new coding practices and coding languages.
          Some examples are Java, HTML, Javascript, CSS, React.js, and 
          C++. I love to code in general and I've been doing it since
          highschool. I'm starting my coding journey by trying to find an 
          exciting and well-paced job.
